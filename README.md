# Hello-World
My world needs practice
This is my first adventure into the IT world, my first dive...or maybe is it more like a plundge!
I want to be able to come and look at this page next year and appreciate my progression and my achievements. 
Is it too much hoping? 
Am I going to be able to master the art of web developing in a year? 
Let's see...
